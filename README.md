# Beacon Application 2

Beacon Application 2, titled "V-Lab", is a microscopy virtual lab simulation.

V-Lab is a virtual biology laboratory, developed by Hellenic Open University, for its students to train in making use of the lab equipment and conducting virtual experiments before they use the on-site lab. The goal is to offer a safe environment for the trainees to learn by trial and error and exploration of various possibilities, without the risk of equipment damages and accidents, and therefore reduce the overall cost of the lab training process.
